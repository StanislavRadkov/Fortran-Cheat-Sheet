## Hello World
``` fortran
program hello
    write(*,*) 'Hello World!'
end
```
## Terminology
* **Statement** - An instruction which is either executabe or
nonexecutable.
* **Construct** - A sequence of statements ending with a
construct terminal statement.
* **Function** - A procedure that returns the value of a single
variable.
* **Procedure** - Either a function or subroutine. Intrinsic
procedure, external procedure, module procedure, internal
procedure, dummy procedure or statement function.
* **Subroutine** - A procedure that is invoked by a CALL
statement or defined assignment statement. It can return more
than one argument.

## Special Characters

* **â€™** (Apostrophe) Editing, declaring a string
* **"** (Quotation Marks) Declaring a string
* **\*** (Asterisk) Comment lines.
* **:** (Colon) Editing.
* **::** (Double Colon) Separator.
* **!** (Exclamation) inline comment.
* **/** (Slash) Skip a line in a fmt statment?
* **;** (Semicolon) Separates Statement on single source line. Except when it is in a character context.
* **&** (Ampersand) Line continuation charachter.

## Data types
* integer 
* real 
* character
* logical
* complex 

## Type Declaration Statements

* dimension - Specifies the dimensions (start and end index) of an array.
* common - Common storage area for variables that are in several program units.
* data - Puts initial values into variables.
* non_overridable - Declares a bound procedure cannot be overridden in a subclass of this class.
* parameter - Makes a variable into a constant with a certain value.
* allocatable - Declares an array is allocatable.
* dimension - Declares the rank and and shape of an array.
* external - Declares that a name is a function external to a pro-gram unit.
* intent - Specifies the intended use of a dummy argument.
* intrinsic - Declares that a name is a specific intrinsic function
* nopass - Declares a bound procedure cannot be overridden in a subclass of this class.
* optional - Declares that a dummey argument is optional.
* parameter - Defines named constant.
* pointer - Declares that a variable is a pointer.
* private - Declares that an object is private to a module.
* protected = Declares that an object in a module is protected, meaning that it can be used but not modified outside the module in which it is defined.
* public - Declares that an object is private to a module.
* save - Declares that an object is private to a module.
* target - Declares that an object is private to a module.
* volatile - Declares that a value of a variable might be changed at any time by some source external to the program.

## User Defined Types
Definition of a new data type called 'personType':

``` fortran
type :: personType
        character(len=100) :: name
        integer :: age
        real :: weight
end type personType
```

Declare an instance of person type:

``` fortran
type (personType) :: p
```

Access properties:

``` fortran
p%name = 'John Doe'
p%age = 45
p%weight = 70
```

## Operators
* Arithmetic Operators:

| Priority | Operation | Symbol | FORTRAN Expression | 
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| inside to outside | Parentheses | ( ) | A*(A+B) | 
| right to left | Exponentiation | ** | A**B |
| left to right | Multiplication | * | A*B |
| left to right | Division | / | A/B |
| left to right | Addition | + | A+B |
| left to right | Subtraction | - | A-B |
| left to right | Unary Minus | - | -A |
 
* Character Operators:

	* Concatenation	- you can do it by using the '//' operator. 
		```fortran
		write(*,*) 'Concate'//'nation'
		```
	* Substring - string(startingIndex:endIndex)
		```fortran
		character(len=20) :: c = 'substring'
		write(*,*) c(1:3)
		```

* Logical Operators (**in order of precedence**):

| Operator |
| :----: |
| .not. |
| .and. |
| .or. | 

* Relational Operators
	
| Operator | Meaning |
| :----: | :----: |
| .eq. | equal to |
| .ne. | not equal to |
| .lt. | less than |
| .le. | less than or equal |
| .gt. | greater than |
| .ge. | greater than or equal |
| .eqv. | equivalent to (for boolean) |
| .neqv. | not equivalent to (for boolean) |

## Arrays

Arrays can be up to seven dimensions. They are stored in column major format. This is not
the same as C which is stored in row major format. ([Row-major order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-major_order "Row-major order"))

Define an array with starting index -3 and end index 3 using the dimension statement:

```fortran
integer, dimension(-3:3) :: arr
data arr/1,2,3,4,5,5,5/
```

You can use the following syntax for repeated values **count\*repeatedValue**:

```fortran
data arr/1,2,3,4,3*5/
```

Access element:

```fortran
arr(-2) ! Output: 2
```

Array subset:

```fortran
arr(-2:2) ! Output: 2 3 4 5 5
```

Define a multidimensional array:

```fortran
integer, dimension(1:3, 1:3) :: arr
data arr/1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9/

write(*,*) arr(1,1:3) ! Output: 1 4 7   
write(*,*) arr(1:3,1) ! Output: 1 2 3
write(*,*) arr(1:3,1:3) ! Output:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

## Loops

A loop can be defined using the following syntax:

```fortran
do  variable = startValue, StopValue [, StepValue]       
	one or more statments
end do
```
StepValue is optional. Default value is 1.

Example, where an iteration is skipped:
```fortran
do i = 1, 10, 2
	if (i.eq.5) then
    	cycle ! Skip iteration
    endif

	write(*,*) "i = ", i
end do
```
Output:
```fortran
 i = 1
 i = 3
 i = 7
 i = 9
```

Implied DO loops are DO loops in the sense that they control the execution of some iterative procedure, but are different than DO loops because they do not use the do statement to control the execution. Basically, these loops are a shorthand that was introduced in FORTRAN to provide a method for array initialization and to cut back on the number of lines of code that where required in the program. Example:

```fortran
write (*,*) (i, i=1, 5) ! Output:  1 2 3 4 5
```
